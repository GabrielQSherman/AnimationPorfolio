# AnimationPorfolio
This is my animation portfolio, I create them for fun and because I like the challange it gives me to try to create complex animations that combined a love for coding and mathematics

I have finally got a fibonacci spiral working in Javascript! it had to give up the idea of creating the spiral right from the start as is. the best way for me to take on this challenge was to start with fibonacci sized boxes. once i was able to create a sucessfull recursion and create a box one at a time(each one having a size of the sum of the previous two boxes) i was then able to do some troubleshoot as to why they were not in the correct orientation for the spiral. i got some very cool looking patterns in the process. using context.translate and context.rotate i was able to get the sequence of created boxes looking good. the next step was to create the arc for each box that would make up one portion of the sprial. this took some guess and check but i was able to complete my goal in good time.
