# Sacred-Geometry Animations

### There are many facets to sacred geometry, I explore symbols that inspire me and that I believe I can recreate and prehaps create something further from. 

I created these animation while working on a 3D sphere animation, when rotating about the X-Y-Z axis and allowing conture lines to form with a diffrent number of points beautiful designs appeared.

The journey of of creating my sirpinski triangle zoom lead me to unknowingly create a flower of life zoom at the same time. This opened my mind to how connected sacred geometry symbolism actually is.

My second dive into render 3D shapes came about with my discovery of the merkabah, as soon as I learned of it I was on a mission to recreated it in 3D using vanilla JS and now you can witness what came of that exploration.

I recreated the metatron cube in 2D, I hope to be able to recreate it in 3D soon aswell.
